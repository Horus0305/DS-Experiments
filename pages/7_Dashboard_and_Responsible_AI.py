# Ethical Considerations
st.header("🌟 Ethical Considerations")

st.markdown("""
### Potential Risks & Mitigation Strategies
""")

st.info("""
**1. Risk: Model may favor premium products over budget options**
- **Mitigation:** Analyzed across price ranges, no systematic bias detected
- **Action:** Regular monitoring of predictions across product segments

**2. Risk: Age-based predictions could discriminate**
- **Mitigation:** Fair performance across all age groups validated
- **Action:** Continuous fairness testing in production

**3. Risk: Model predictions could influence business decisions unfairly**
- **Mitigation:** Positioned as decision support tool, not replacement for human judgment
- **Action:** Human oversight mandatory for critical decisions

**4. Risk: Data drift could degrade model performance over time**
- **Mitigation:** Monitoring pipeline planned, regular retraining scheduled
- **Action:** Monthly performance reviews and quarterly retraining

**5. Risk: Over-reliance on model predictions**
- **Mitigation:** Clear communication of limitations, confidence levels always shown
- **Action:** Training for business users on proper model usage

# Model Limitations
st.header("⚠️ Model Limitations & Disclaimers")

st.warning("""
**Known Limitations:**

1. **Temporal Limitations:**
   - Model trained on historical data (2020-2024)
   - May not capture future market trends or shifts
   - Recommendation: Retrain quarterly with latest data

2. **Scope Limitations:**
   - Focused on The Whole Truth Foods product categories
   - May not generalize to other food brands or industries
   - Recommendation: Validate before applying to new categories

3. **Data Limitations:**
   - Training data may not cover all edge cases
   - Limited to available product attributes
   - Recommendation: Collect additional features for future versions

4. **Performance Limitations:**
   - 95% accuracy means 5% error rate (~50 errors per 1000 predictions)
   - Higher error rate for Naive Bayes model (24% error)
   - Recommendation: Always review low-confidence predictions

5. **Interpretability Trade-offs:**
   - Neural networks less interpretable than logistic regression
   - SHAP approximations may not capture full complexity
   - Recommendation: Use multiple explanation methods
